Yes — **you can pull this off 100% for free**, *with caveats*. Here's how to do it with **zero cost**, and where you might hit limitations that matter only at scale.

---

## ✅ What You Can Do for Free

### 1. **HiveMQ Cloud (Free Tier)**

* ✅ Up to **100 simultaneous MQTT connections**
* ✅ TLS-encrypted communication
* ✅ 10 topics per client (practical limit, not hard limit)
* ❗ **No persistent sessions** (if client disconnects, messages are lost unless retained/QoS)
* ✅ Enough for dev, test, and early production

**Good Enough?** Yes, unless you need retained messages or guaranteed delivery offline.

---

### 2. **Flutter App (Free)**

* ✅ `mqtt_client` is open-source
* ✅ `firebase_messaging` for FCM is free
* ✅ Firebase setup (token management, receiving notifications) costs nothing on the client side

**Good Enough?** Yes. No limits hit unless you're pushing to thousands of users.

---

### 3. **Firestore (Free Tier)**

* ✅ 50K document reads/day
* ✅ 20K writes/day
* ✅ 1GB storage
* ✅ Fits hourly logging easily

**Good Enough?** Yes, for logging \~100 devices hourly you’re fine.

---

### 4. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**

* ✅ Unlimited push notifications (yes, literally)
* ✅ Works on iOS/Android/web
* ❗ Requires correct setup of APNs (iOS) and background handlers

**Good Enough?** Yes — but **delivery not guaranteed if app is killed on iOS** (Apple’s policy)

---

### 5. **Backend / Notification Bridge — Free Options**

#### Option A: **Cloud Function on Firebase (free tier)**

* ✅ 2M invocations/month
* ✅ 400K GB-seconds/month
* ✅ Supports Node.js + Firebase Admin SDK
* ❗ Cold starts may delay alert slightly (1-2s worst case)
* ❗ Cloud Functions are **not ideal** for long-lived MQTT connections

**Better Use:** Trigger push only when ESP32 writes alert to **Firestore**, not MQTT directly.

#### Option B: **Free VPS (via Render, Railway, etc.)**

* ✅ Can run a persistent MQTT client 24/7
* ✅ Free plans include \~500 hours/month
* ❗ Slightly more setup
* ❗ Watch for idle shutdown (Render's free tier can stop if no traffic)

**Best Use:** Persistent MQTT connection + push logic in one place

#### Option C: **Run it locally or on your own Raspberry Pi**

* ✅ Free (if you already have the hardware)
* ❗ Uptime depends on your network
* ❗ No scaling, but fine for hobby/early testing

## 🧠 Realistic Free System Blueprint

| Component            | Tool                     | Free? | Comments                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| MQTT Broker          | HiveMQ Cloud Free        | ✅     | Max 100 connections                 |
| Real-time Monitoring | Flutter + mqtt\_client   | ✅     | UI-only logic fine                  |
| Data Logging         | Firebase Firestore       | ✅     | Up to 20K writes/day                |
| Push Notifications   | Firebase Cloud Messaging | ✅     | Works well, just configure properly |
| Alert Trigger        | Firebase Cloud Function  | ✅     | Trigger on Firestore write          |

---

## 🔁 What You Should *Not* Do for Free (Yet)

* ❌ **Don't use Firebase Cloud Functions to maintain a persistent MQTT connection** (they time out). Use Firestore as the alert trigger if using Firebase only.
* ❌ **Don’t assume background MQTT works on mobile** — it doesn’t. You *need* FCM for push.

---

## 🔧 Best All-Free Strategy for You

1. **ESP32**

   * Publishes sensor data and alert flags to HiveMQ **and Firestore**
   * Example: sends `{ temp: 70, alert: true }` to Firestore `/sensors/device_id`

2. **Flutter App**

   * Subscribes to HiveMQ → shows real-time UI
   * Registers FCM token → saved to Firestore under `/users/user_id/fcm_token`

3. **Firebase Cloud Function (serverless)**

   * Triggered when Firestore doc is updated with `alert: true`
   * Uses Firebase Admin SDK to send push via FCM

**= Entirely free system, and it scales until you're pushing thousands of users or hammering Firestore.**

## Want the Cloud Function Code?

Let me know and I’ll give you the full `index.js` + `package.json` setup for that Firestore trigger → FCM push. All copy-paste ready.


Exactly. You **don’t need multiple Firebase projects** — **just one** Firebase project is enough to handle both **Firestore** and **FCM**. Here's what your architecture should look like, **minimally and correctly configured**:

---

## ✅ You Need These 3 Core Components:

### 1. **HiveMQ Cloud Cluster**

* Purpose: Real-time data pipeline between ESP32 and app
* Use: ESP32 publishes sensor data to MQTT topics
* App subscribes to same topics for live monitoring + control
* **Free Tier is enough** (up to 100 MQTT clients)

---

### 2. **Single Firebase Project**

* Handles **both** Firestore and Cloud Messaging (FCM)
* You don’t need two separate Firebase projects
* Inside this project, you'll use:

#### 🔹 Firestore (for logging):

* ESP32 can send hourly sensor logs (via REST API or via Flutter app proxy)
* Flutter app can also write logs if it receives from MQTT and stores hourly snapshots

#### 🔹 Firebase Cloud Messaging (for push notifications):

* Flutter app registers FCM token
* Firestore stores this token under the user/device
* Your **Cloud Function** (or backend) sends push via FCM using these tokens when alerts are triggered

#### 🔹 (Optional) Firebase Cloud Functions:

* Triggered on Firestore `alerts` collection changes (or document writes)
* Sends FCM push messages automatically
* Runs **completely free** under Firebase Free tier unless you abuse it

| Tool / Service           | Purpose                                | Required?      | Free? | Where to Set It Up                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **HiveMQ Cloud**         | MQTT broker (real-time data & control) | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes | [hivemq.com](https://www.hivemq.com)               |
| **Firebase Project**     | Logging & notifications                | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes | [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com) |
| Firestore                | Store hourly logs, alert flags         | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes | Inside Firebase project                            |
| Firebase Cloud Messaging | Deliver push notifications to devices  | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes | Inside same Firebase project                       |
| Firebase Cloud Functions | Serverless backend for push alerts     | ⚠️ Recommended | ✅ Yes | Inside same Firebase project                       |

### ✅ Example Firebase Project Structure

```
Firebase Project: my-sensor-app
├── Firestore
│   ├── /logs/{deviceId}/entries → hourly logs
│   ├── /alerts/{deviceId}       → alert writes trigger push
│   └── /users/{userId}/fcmToken
├── Firebase Cloud Messaging
│   └── Sends push to fcmToken from Cloud Function
├── Cloud Functions
│   └── onWrite(/alerts/{deviceId}) → sends FCM push
```

---

### ⚠️ DON'T DO THIS:

* ❌ Don’t create separate Firebase projects for Firestore and FCM — makes auth/config painful
* ❌ Don’t assume the app will always be open — use FCM for critical alerts
* ❌ Don’t rely on MQTT alone for notification handling — use Firestore + Functions to decouple logic

---

Want me to scaffold the Firebase Cloud Function that listens to `/alerts/{deviceId}` and sends FCM push? It’ll plug straight into this setup.
